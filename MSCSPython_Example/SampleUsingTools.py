import Tools

# importing the tools(packages) that has been downloaded for further work
# from A import B: from package(A) import method(B), that could be just used(e.g  time.sleep(1) -> sleep(1)). Also, in the place of the method, "*" means to import all the methods in the package.


Tools.sleep(1)  # A method in package "Tools". Look at Tools(Python Package) -> _init_.py for further information.
