Python

Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic data types.
Python was invented by Guido van Rossum in late 1989, and the first public release was released in 1991.
Like the Perl language, the Python source code follows the GPL (GNU General Public License).

Python 3.x
    The 3.0 version of Python, often referred to as Python 3000, or Py3k for short.
This is a major upgrade compared to earlier versions of Python.
In order not to bring too much burden,
Python 3.0 was not designed with backward compatibility in mind.
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
What is the difference between the 2.x and 3.x?
    Many programs designed for earlier Python versions do not work properly on Python 3.0.
To accommodate existing programs, Python 2.6 is a transitional version that basically uses Python 2.x syntax and libraries,
while considering the migration to Python 3.0,
allowing some python 3.0 syntax and functions to be used.
The new Python program recommends the syntax of the Python 3.0 version.
Unless the execution environment cannot install Python 3.0 or the program itself uses a third-party library that does not support Python 3.0.
Third-party libraries that currently do not support Python 3.0 are Twisted, py2exe, PIL, etc.
